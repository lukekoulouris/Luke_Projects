Hi! This is my reposity for most of my personal and academic projects. Currently, my master's thesis is investigating how the staggered legalization of sports gambling affects the household's finances and health outcomes via the Household Pulse Survey and American Time Use Survey. Previous projects include my undergraduate honors thesis that sought to determine how delaying school start times impact adolescent fatal car accidents and my teaching tool that shows how changes in supply and demand elasticities affect market equilibrium.
