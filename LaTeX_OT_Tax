\begin{frame}{\textbf{Income Tax Cuts}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Past past presidential administrations have implemented tax cuts as a way to put more money back in the hands of Americans
        \item While this seems like a good thing, it has lead to \textbf{increased income inequality} and has tended to give \textbf{larger benefits to those at the top of the income distribution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Those within the bottom quintile of the income distribution receive the lowest tax cuts as a result of the Trump 2017 tax cuts at 0.3\% of after tax income while those within the 95th and 99th percentile receive the largest tax breaks at 3.4\%
        \end{itemize}
        \item Not only do tax cuts increase income inequality, it also increases the economic gap between White people and everyone else
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Background}}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Current administration is pushing for no tax on overtime compensation
    \item Keep Every Extra Penny Act of 2025
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No tax on income earned beyond 40 hours per week
    \end{itemize}
    \item Other proposed bills to reduce or eliminate taxes on overtime wages include the Overtime Pay tax Relief Act of 2025 and the No tax on Overtime Act
    \item Exempting overtime from tax is estimated to cost the US between \textbf{\$680 billion and \$1.5 trillion} over a decade
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Overtime in the US}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Approximately 67\% of salary and hourly employment, or about 97.7 million employees, were \textit{eligible} for overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FSLA)
        \item Of that 67\%, only about 8\% of hourly and 4\% of salary employees work over 40 hours per week regularly
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{No Tax on Overtime}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The US would not be the first place to implement no tax on overtime if the KEEP Act were to be passed
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Austria, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy (for a second), and even Alabama have implemented policies regarding taxes on overtime
    \end{itemize}
    \item This seems like a great idea, so why isn't there no tax on overtime?
\end{itemize}   
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Economic Theory}}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{budget constarint OT.png}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Those who work 40 hours might be induced to work more
    \item Those who work more than 40 hours might be induced to work less
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Results From Around the World}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{France:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented: 2007-2012; 2019-Present
        \item Limit of apprx. \$8,500 per year (7,500 Euros)
        \item Findings: There is an increase in overtime hours, but authors believe that it's mostly for tax optimization, rather than an actual increase in overtime hours worked
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Results From Around the World Cont.}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alabama:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented: January 2024 - June 30, 2025
        \item There is no limit to the amount of overtime hours
        \item Findings: 5\% increase in volunteered overtime hours and increases in LFPR, BUT there have been massive decreases in state revenue (obviously) and even greater losses than they predicted
        \item Projected to cost \$34 million annually and \textbf{ended up costing \$230 million} within its first year
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Conclusion and Future Research}}\
\begin{itemize}
    \item I think that, while well intentioned, an elimination to overtime taxes is \textbf{too costly} to the state/country and the benefits of such policy would be outweighed by the lack of revenue the state/country would be receiving
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I would be open to seeing a reduction in overtime tax or limits to the amount of tax exempt hours
    \end{itemize}
    \item I think a good way to measure such employment effects in an econometric way would be a synthetic control approach to Alabama, since they are the only state in the US to have implemented such as policy
\end{itemize}
